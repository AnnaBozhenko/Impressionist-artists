                    <p>
                        Frédéric Bazille had both exquisite timing and terrible luck. He was one of a group of radical, iconoclastic artists in early 1860s 
                        Paris - Manet, Monet, and Renoir among them - to turn the artistic establishment upside down with their revolutionary new approach to
                         painting. Manet was something of a mentor and certainly a good friend to Bazille. Bazille received only a relatively limited amount 
                         of formal academic artistic instruction but his close alliances with fellow artists, including sharing studios with the likes of Renoir,
                          Sisley, and Monet, helped shape his style. His paintings were just as often accepted as refused by the official Salon and, while he adopted 
                          some of the techniques and formal qualities of the Impressionist style, his work remained Realist except in the realm of subject matter. He 
                          was a pioneer in creating compositional strategies for situating human figures in outdoor settings and integrating them with the atmospheric
                           effects of a given locale. He worked often in his studio but was also an advocate of painting en plein air, which Monet had encouraged him 
                           to do from early on. Bazille received positive support from important critics of the day and his career was taking very promising shape when
                            he was killed just before his 29th birthday in a battle during the Franco-Prussian War.

                <h3>Childhood and Education</h3>
                <p>Frédéric Bazille, born Jean-Frédéric, was born into a wealthy family with ancient roots in the South of France. He was born on the family's estate, Meric, 
                    outside of Montpellier on December 5th (some sources say the 6th) in 1841. The Bazille family had settled in the area at least as early as the 13th century.
                     He came from a family of artisans, including an 18th-century ancestor who was a master arquebusier, "a renowned weapons specialist and producer of luxury
                      works of art ... who worked for the king." Eventually, the family channeled their artisanal skills into goldsmithing with which they earned a reputation
                       for excellence as well as their fortune. One of the family treasures, which had eventually made its way to his mother, Camille Vialars Bazille, was a 
                       famously beautiful and extravagant ring "of diamonds with seven rosette stones" designed by Daniel Bazille in 1720.

                <h3>Early Training</h3>
                <p>
                    In 1862, Bazille moved to Paris; he enrolled at the Faculty of Medicine. During his leisure time, rather than studying, he painted. Quickly, he began 
                    neglecting his studies and instead attended the artist Charles Gleyre's drawing workshop. Gleyre was a well-known academic painter who specialized in
                     history painting, still considered by the art establishment to be the most noble of genres. He had taken over the studio of the famous history painter,
                      Paul Delaroche. Some of his best-known students were Monet, Renoir, and Sisley, all of whom Bazille met when he attended the workshops at Gleyre's studio. 
                      Ironically, none of them remained for long under Gleyre's tutelage, as they did not agree with his academic approach to teaching art.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By 1864, Bazille had failed his medical exam, largely due to disinterest, and at last his father reluctantly agreed to provide him with support so that he
                     could pursue painting full time. Bazille had received plenty of encouragement both from Gleyre and his avant garde artist friends, Monet, Sisley, and Manet.
                      In turn, he was a generous friend who often provided his struggling artist friends with support - sometimes with money and most often by lending them 
                      materials and studio space.By 1864, Bazille had failed his medical exam, largely due to disinterest, and at last his father reluctantly agreed to provide

                <div class="image-block">
                    <p>
                    Bazille painted almost feverishly from 1863 to 1870. After leaving the workshop of Gleyre, he established his own studio. He occupied a total of six studios
                     through the years, with three of them - one on rue de Furstenberg, one on rue de Visconti, and one on rue de la Condamine - documented via his paintings,
                      which have been characterized by some art historians as "indirect self-portraits." As he received a generous monthly allowance from his parents, Bazille 
                      could maintain a comfortable apartment, which he sometimes shared with friends, and also shared studio space with fellow artists. In 1864, he and Monet 
                      shared the rue de Furstenberg studio. He shared his space on rue de Visconti in 1867 with Renoir, and sometimes Sisley and Monet. From time to time, he
                       would also pay for models for the group of artists to draw and paint, when money was tight they'd also model for one another. By 1868, Bazille had
                        acquired the large studio on rue de la Condamine in the Batignolles district.

                    <p>
                    By 1870, Bazille had achieved considerable renown and respect for his work. However, fate stepped in when France declared war on Prussia on July 19, 1870.
                     As the Prussians moved further into French territory later in the summer and a full-scale invasion of France was inevitable, the passionate young Bazille 
                     went to a military recruitment office on August 10, 1870 and enlisted in the 3rd Zouaves light infantry regiment.

                <h3>The Legacy of Frédéric Bazille</h3>
                <p>
                    Bazille made his mark as a Realist artist whose most lasting contribution was through paintings featuring figures situated in landscapes, produced en plein air. 
                    By working out the process of combining two very traditional motifs - the landscape and the portrait - and allowing neither to usurp the other in importance, 
                    he helped establish along with close colleagues like Renoir and Monet, one of the core motifs of Impressionism: the genre scene of a figure or group relaxing 
                    in an outdoor setting. These outdoor scenes are produced in a less academic style that is anticipatory of the Impressionist style and Bazille has been referred 
                    to as a "Proto-Impressionist." Until some of his paintings appeared in the Universal Exhibition of 1900 in Paris, Bazille's work had not exerted much influence
                     on artists who followed the Impressionists. By 1910, when a modest retrospective of his work was presented at the Salon d'Automne (Autumn Salon), avant garde 
                     artists like Picasso began to take notice thanks to critic and writer Guillaume Apollinaire's recognition of Bazille's modernism, including his direct link 
                     to Manet and the way in which the two artists radically reimagined the nude, both male and female.
