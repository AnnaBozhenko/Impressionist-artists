                    <p>
                        Paul Cézanne was the preeminent French artist of the Post-Impressionist era, widely appreciated toward the end of his life for insisting that 
                        painting stay in touch with its material, virtually sculptural origins. Also known as the "Master of Aix" after his ancestral home in the South
                         of France, Cézanne is credited with paving the way for the emergence of twentieth-century modernism, both visually and conceptually. In retrospect,
                          his work constitutes the most powerful and essential link between the ephemeral aspects of Impressionism and the more materialist, artistic 
                          movements of Fauvism, Cubism, Expressionism, and even complete abstraction.

                <h3>Childhood</h3>
                <div class="image-block">
                    <p>
                        Paul Cézanne was born in 1839 in the town of Aix-en-Provence in the South of France. His father was a wealthy lawyer and banker who strongly encouraged Paul 
                        to follow in his footsteps. Cézanne's eventual rejection of his authoritative father's aspirations led to a long, problematic relationship between the two, 
                        although, notably, the artist remained financially dependent on his family until his father's death in 1886.
                    </p>
                    <p> He was extremely close friends with Émile Zola, a writer born in Aix as well, and who would later become one of the greatest literary figures of his generation. 
                        The adventurous were part of a small circle that called themselves "The Inseperables". They moved to Paris together in 1861.

                <h3>Early training</h3>
                <p>
                    Cézanne was largely a self-taught artist. In 1859, he attended evening drawing classes in his native town of Aix. After moving to Paris, Cézanne twice attempted 
                    to enter the École des Beaux-Arts, but was turned down by the jury. Instead of acquiring professional training, Cézanne made frequent visits to the Musée de Louvre,
                     where he copied works by Titian, Rubens, and Michelangelo. He also regularly visited the Académie Suisse, a studio where young art students could draw from the
                     
                     live model for a very modest monthly membership fee. While at the Académie, Cézanne met fellow painters Camille Pissarro, Claude Monet, and Auguste Renoir, who 
                     were at that time also struggling artists, but who would soon comprise the founding members of the nascent Impressionist movement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The early oils of Cézanne were executed in a rather somber palette. The paint was often applied in thick layers of impasto, adding a sense of heaviness to already 
                    solemn compositions. His early painting indicated a focus on color in favor of well-delineated silhouettes and perspectives preferred by the French Academy and 
                    the jury of the annual Salon where he continuously submitted his works. All of his submissions, however, were refused. The artist also travelled regularly back to
                     Aix to secure funding from his disapproving father.
                </p>
                <h3>Mature period</h3>
                <div class="image-block">
                    <p>Cézanne's experience with painting from nature and rigourous experimentation led him to develop his own approaches to art. He strove to depart from the portrayal 
                    of the transient moment, long favored by the Impressionists; instead, Cézanne sought true and permanent pictorial qualities of objects around him. According to
                     Cézanne, the subject of the painting was first to be "read" by the artist through the understanding of its essence. Then, in the second stage, this essence must 
                     be "realized" on a canvas through forms, colors, and their spatial relations. The colors and forms thus became the dominant elements of his compositions, completely
                      freed from the rigid rules of perspective and paint application as promoted by the Academy.

                <h3>The Legacy of Paul Cézanne</h3>
                <div class="image-block">
                    <p>When looking at Cézanne's late work, it is impossible to miss the emergence of a unique artistic approach. Cézanne offered a new way of comprehending the world 
                    through art. With his reputation evolving steadily in the late years of his life, an increasing number of young artists fell under the influence of his innovative
                     vision. Among them was the young Pablo Picasso, who would soon steer the Western tradition of painting into yet another new and utterly unprecedented direction. 
                     It was Cézanne who taught the new generation of artists to liberate form from color in their art, thus creating a new and subjective pictorial reality, not merely
                      a slavish imitation. The influence of Cézanne continued well into the 1930s and 1940s, when a new artistic manner was coming to fruition - that of Abstract 
                      Expressionism.
