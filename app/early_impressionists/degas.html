                        <p> Always remembered as an Impressionist, Edgar Degas was a member of the seminal group of Paris artists who began to exhibit together in the 1870s.
                         He shared many of their novel techniques, was intrigued by the challenge of capturing effects of light and attracted to scenes of urban leisure.
                          But Degas's academic training, and his own personal predilection toward Realism, set him apart from his peers, and he rejected the label 
                          'Impressionist' preferring to describe himself as an 'Independent.' His inherited wealth gave him the comfort to find his own way, and later 
                          it also enabled him to withdraw from the Paris art world and sell pictures at his discretion. He was intrigued by the human figure, and in his 
                          many images of women - dancers, singers, and laundresses - he strove to capture the body in unusual positions. While critics of the Impressionists
                           focused their attacks on their formal innovations, it was Degas's lower-class subjects that brought him the most disapproval.

                    <h3>Childhood</h3>
                    <p>
                        Edgar Degas was the eldest of five children of Célestine Musson de Gas, an American by birth, and Auguste de Gas, a banker. Edgar later changed his surname 
                        to the less aristocratic sounding 'Degas' in 1870. Born into a wealthy Franco-Italian family, he was encouraged from an early age to pursue the arts, though
                         not as a long-term career. Following his graduation in 1853 with a baccalaureate in literature, the eighteen-year-old Degas registered at the Louvre as a 
                         copyist, which he claimed later in life is the foundation for any true artist.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After a brief period at law school, he gave up on the his father's aspirations of Degas becoming a lawyer. In 1855 he was admitted to the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, 
                        where he studied drawing under the academic artist Louis Lamothe, a former pupil of Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres. Degas is even later said to follow Ingres's maxim: 
                        "Draw lines, young man., draw lines." That same year, the Exposition Universelle took place, and Degas was enthralled by Gustave Courbet's Pavilion of Realism.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Early Period and Training</h3>
                    <div class="image-block">
                        <p>
                        In 1856, when Degas was aged 22, he traveled to Naples, Italy, to visit his aunt, the Baroness Bellelli and her family. This three-year trip was an important 
                        moment in his development, and resulted in the Realist portrait The Bellelli Family (1859). He spent countless hours combing the museums and galleries of Italy, 
                        carefully studying Renaissance works by Michelangelo, Raphael and Titian, among others.

                        </figure>
                        <p>
                            In 1864, while copying a picture by Velázquez at the Louvre, he met Édouard Manet, who by chance was copying the same painting. His friendship with Manet was 
                            instrumental for Degas, and probably for Manet, and even the development of Impressionism as a whole. The outspoken, well-regarded Manet was a very different 
                            personality from the introspective, and often self-doubting Degas. But their friendship and close association lasted until the end of Manet's life and is 
                            discussed in detail in Sebastian Smee's book "The Art of Rivalry".

                    <h3>Mature Period</h3>
                    <div class="image-block">
                        <p>
                            Although the 1860s was a productive period in Degas's career, his most renowned body of work was created in the 1870s. By this time he had discovered his true 
                            muse - Paris. He (much as Manet and other Impressionists) drew inspiration from its boulevards, cafés, shops, dance studios, drawing rooms, theaters, and operas.
                             And he became well known for his close observation, devoting much time to capturing the detail of surrounding human beings. Perhaps for this reason he rejected
                              the label 'Impressionist', believing it implied something accidental and incomplete.
                        </p>
                        <figure class="left-side">
                            <img src="../images/canvases/edgar-degas-in-a-cafe.jpg">
                            <figcaption> «У кафе»</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Evidence of this can be found in seminal works such as Foyer de la Danse (1872), Musicians in the Orchestra (1872) and A Carriage at the Races (1873). Each of these 
                        pictures also exemplify how Degas assumed unconventional points-of-view, suggesting the perspective of a distracted spectator. Yet unlike contemporaries like Renoir 
                        and Monet, Degas was not a plein air painter, preferring instead the light and reliability of the studio. Incidentally, his few outdoor scenes were produced from
                         memory, or conjured in part from his imagination.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Late period</h3>
                    <div class="image-block">
                        <p>
                            As the 19th century came to a close, Degas's pace of work waned, and he began spending more time collecting the works of other artists he admired. He purchased work 
                            by contemporaries such as Manet, Pissarro, van Gogh, Gauguin and Cézanne, as well as older artists who had informed Degas as a young man, like Delacroix and Ingres.
                             Late works, like the bronze Woman Rubbing Her Back with a Sponge (1900), is a testament to Degas's continued devotion to capturing the female form.

                        <p>
                            Although Degas abandoned oil painting later in life, he continued to work in a variety of media, including pastels and photography, yet sculpture became his preferred 
                            medium as his eyesight deteriorated. He increasingly became a recluse, and most of his friendships with artists like Monet and Renoir, eventually dissolved. These
                            ruptures were hastened by Degas's outspoken anti-Semitism, which was amplified by his stance during the infamous Dreyfus Affair. He died in 1917.

                    <h3>The legacy of Edgar Degas</h3>
                    <p>
                        Although Degas suffered criticism during his lifetime, by the time of his death his reputation was secure as one of the leaders of late-19th-century French art. 
                        His distinct difference from the Impressionists, his greater tendency toward Realism, had also come to be appreciated. His standing has only increased since his death, 
                        though since the 1970s he was been the focus of a lot of scholarly attention and criticism, primarily focused around his images of women, which have been seen as misogynistic.
                         Some have even compared his treatment of the other sex linked to his antisemitism and overall lack of moral compass.
