                        <p>When the second Impressionist exhibition opened in the spring of 1876 in Paris, one sharp-tongued critic described its participants as 
                            "five or six lunatics, one of which is a woman." The woman, of course, was Berthe Morisot, who in spite of her gender became a leading 
                            figure of the most famous artistic movement of the 19th century. The label of "lunatic," however, was an aberration. Morisot cultivated
                             her artistic talents and achieved success at an early age with acceptance to the Salon at age 23, and tenaciously held on to her rank 
                             at the forefront of French painters until her death 30 years later. Though frequently self-critical of her own work, and barred by social
                              conventions from pursuing the same subject matter as her male counterparts, Morisot nonetheless developed the connections and familial 
                              support that enabled her to carve out her own independent career as an artist for more than three decades and leave a permanent mark 
                              on the direction of French art.</p>

                    <h3>Childhood</h3>
                    <div class="image-block">
                        <p>
                            Berthe Morisot was born to Edmé Tiburce Morisot and Marie-Joséphine-Cornélie Thomas in Bourges, France, in 1841. The family was well-off and her father 
                            worked as a senior administrator for the local government. Her mother was related to the Rococo painter Jean-Honore Fragonard. Morisot had two older sisters, 
                            Yves and Edma, and also a younger brother Tiburce. In 1852, the family moved to Paris, where Morisot would live for the rest of her life.
                        </p>
                        <figure>

                        </figure>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>As the daughters of a bourgeois family, it was expected that Berthe and her sisters would receive an artistic education. The painter Joseph Guichard, one of 
                        their private tutors, took them to the Louvre, where he taught them to learn by copying the paintings on the walls. Guichard notably warned the girls' 
                        parents that continuing their artistic education could be problematic: "Given your daughters' natural gifts, it will not be petty drawing-room talents
                         that my instruction will achieve; they will become painters. Are you fully aware of what that means? It will be revolutionary - I would almost say 
                         catastrophic - in your haute bourgeoisie milieu."
                    </p>
                    <p>However, Edma and Berthe continued to be taught even after this warning. After a while, however, Edma married a naval officer and moved away to have children, 
                        meaning she gave up her serious artistic pursuits. But, she did continue to encourage Berthe (with whom she was very close) to continue working.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Early training and work</h3>
                    <p>
                        Morisot responded by registering as a copyist at the Louvre. When she was there, she got to know other artists including the landscape painter Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot.
                         He encouraged her to start working en plein air, where she began to produce her first serious paintings. She studied painting extensively during this period, and was also
                          taught sculpture, although none of her sculptural works survived.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 1864, when Morisot was only 23, the official Parisian Salon accepted two of her landscape paintings. As a young woman, this was an almost-unheard-of achievement. 
                        One critic responded by saying, "You see, ladies, one may be an artist and take part in public exhibitions of painting and remain, as before, a very respectable and 
                        very charming person." She continued to show at the Salon for several years, where her work was generally well-received.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Mature Period</h3>
                    <p>
                        In 1868, Morisot met the effective leader of avant-garde painting in Paris, Édouard Manet. Manet famously wrote in a letter to Henri Fantin-Latour, "the [two sisters] 
                        Morisot are delightful. What a shame they aren't men; nonetheless they might, as women, serve the cause of painting by each marrying an academicien" (men who were jurors 
                        of the French Academy). Manet and Morisot immediately became quite close, and began to provide feedback on each other's work. Professionally however, Morisot was upset when Manet 
                        made his own additions to one of her Salon submissions more nonchalantly than Morisot desired, suggesting that Manet didn't see the relationship as wholly reciprocal.
                    </p>
                    <p>Nonetheless, Manet evidently respected Morisot's opinion and work as an artist. Notably, Morisot prompted Manet to take up en plein air painting, which was a significant 
                        move in his artistic practice. Manet painted Morisot 12 times, making her his most frequent subject. He completed a particularly famous portrait of Morisot in 1872, 
                        where he depicted her wearing a black dress, with a confident, intelligent gaze. According to critic Sue Roe, Manet's 1868 work The Balcony depicts Morisot and 
                        "focused on her air of compelling beauty, her mystery and the complex inner struggle reflected in her face."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It has been suggested that the pair were romantically involved, but couldn't pursue a relationship as Manet was already married by the time they met. It stands to remember that 
                        Manet was quite the playboy of his time, regularly attending brothels and reportedly keeping company with many women outside of his marriage. Whether the two had a passionate affair, 
                        or Morisot was the exception to Manet's supposed habits, is unknown. Through the letters left by Morisot we do know she cared deeply for the charismatic Manet.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 1872, Morisot sold 22 paintings to the private dealer Durand-Ruel, marking the start of her career as an established artist. Through her connection with Manet, Morisot was
                         drawn into his circle of painters who were later known as the Impressionists. Manet himself refused to leave his more traditional art career and encouraged Morisot not to 
                         join the avant-garde group. However, Morisot didn't take his advice and her work was included in the first ever exhibition of Impressionist painting in 1874, pointing to her
                          importance within the growing movement.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Late period</h3>
                    <div class="image-block">
                        <p>
                            Unlike her sister, Morisot continued to paint while also carving out a life as a wife and a mother. In 1878, she and Eugène welcomed their first and only child, Julie. 
                            Morisot frequently painted her daughter, and as a child Julie also posed for several other painters such as Manet and Renoir.
                        </p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../images/canvases/morisot_the-beach-at-petit-dalles-aka-on-the-beach.jpg">

                    </div>
                    
                    <p>
                        Throughout her career, Morisot had close friendships with many members of the Impressionist circle, including Degas, Monet, Renoir, and the poet Mallarme. She continued 
                        to be actively involved in the Impressionist group, exhibiting with them every year except 1878. She even organized the final Impressionist exhibition in 1886 entirely single-handedly.
                         After the demise of the Impressionist group as an organized movement she continued to exhibit with avant-garde artists, contributing several works to the Belgian group Les XX's 
                         show in Brussels in 1887 and four paintings in 1894 to that of its successor, La Libre Esthetique. Unusually, Morisot always exhibited under her maiden name instead of using 
                         a pseudonym or her married name.
                    </p>
                    <h3>The Legacy of Berthe Morisot</h3>
                    <p>
                        Throughout her career, Berthe Morisot had to fight against preconceptions of women and their role. She was highly unusual in her decision to be an artist as well as a wife and mother, 
                        but many people inevitably saw her primarily in her traditionally female roles. Therefore, until recently it has been assumed that Manet was the "master" and Morisot the "student" 
                        in their relationship, but it is certainly arguable that they influenced each other in different ways.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although she has been forgotten in some corners, Morisot was an important figure in the founding of Impressionism as a movement; she participated in their first exhibition and was 
                        a key artistic and social figure within their circle. Morisot was also a strong encouraging influence on other female Impressionist painters living in Paris at the time, such as 
                        Mary Cassatt and Eva Gonzalès.
