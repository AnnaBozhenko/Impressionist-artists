                    <p>Even up to the 1950s, Gustave Caillebotte was relatively unknown despite achieving much in Paris during the reign of the Impressionists.
                         Like many of his fellow avant-garde artists, he was fascinated by the impact of industrialization and modernization on the city of
                          Paris and its inhabitants. While he is classified as an Impressionist, the paintings that are considered by most to be his masterpieces 
                          actually fall more into the category of Realism, like the work of his predecessors, Millet and Courbet, and even Degas or Monet's 
                          earlier work. Individual paintings in his oeuvre frequently feature the distinctive, loose brushwork and lighter palette of the Impressionist 
                          style, but the paintings for which he is best known are large-scale, precise "evocations of photographic naturalism," as one contemporary
                           critic put it, although at the time the comment was meant to be taken pejoratively. Ultimately, what he had most in common with his Impressionist
                            colleagues was his choice of subject matter: he depicted themes from everyday life rather than those favored by formally trained, academic painters.

                <h3>Childhood and Education</h3>
                    <p>
                        Gustave Caillebotte was born into a wealthy Parisian family on August 19, 1848. The family lived in Paris on the rue du Faubourg-Saint-Denis. 
                        Martial Caillebotte, his father, had inherited his family's military textile business. Additionally, the elder Caillebotte was a judge at the 
                        Tribunal de commerce in the Seine department. He had already been widowed twice by the time he married his third wife and Gustave's mother, 
                        Celeste Daufresne. The eldest of her three children with Martial, Gustave had two younger brothers, Rene and Martial.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 1860, the family began going for the summer to their estate in Yerres, which was 12 miles south of Paris on the Yerres River. His father had purchased 
                        land there, including a large home, and it was there on the family's extensively landscaped property where the young Caillebotte first began drawing and painting.
                    </p>
                <h3>Early Training</h3>
                <div class="image-block">
                    <p>Following the war, Caillebotte began pursuing his artistic career with increased fervor. He visited the studio of the well-respected academic painter Léon Bonnat, who encouraged 
                    him to begin taking a career in art seriously. Bonnat, a Realist painter who had influential friends like the writer Émile Zola and artists Edgar Degas and Édouard
                    Manet, was a teacher at the prestigious École des Beaux Arts. Among Bonnat's more famous students through the years were Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, John Singer 
                    Sargent, Thomas Eakins, Georges Braque, Jean Beraud, and Edvard Munch. Caillebotte threw himself enthusiastically into his new vocation, including enrolling in 
                    the École des Beaux-Arts in 1873, although he spent very little time there, preferring his own studio in his family's home.

                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Caillebotte's father died in 1874. His brother Rene died only two years later and in 1878, his mother died, leaving the two remaining sons, Gustave and Martial, to divide
                     the family fortune between them. Around the time that his father died, Caillebotte made some vital connections in the art world, befriending a number of artists who were not
                      involved with the French Academy, including Monet, Renoir, Pissarro, and De Nittis. He was a colleague and, in some cases, close friend of some of the most important avant-garde 
                      artists of the period.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Caillebotte made his artistic debut in 1876 at the second exhibition of the Impressionists (there were 8 exhibitions total), the loosely knit group of artist also known as the
                     "Independents," the "Intentionalists," and the "Intransigents." In keeping with the Impressionists' avant-garde style, a rejection of academic painting and the formalities of 
                     the traditional exhibition protocols of the official Salon, Caillebotte, Renoir, Monet, and others produced small, independent exhibitions of their work.
                </p>
                <h3>Mature Period</h3>
                <div class="image-block">
                    <p>
                        By the time of the third Impressionist exhibition in 1877, Caillebotte had become not only a central organizer of what had evolved into an independent, unofficial, and distinctly
                         avant-garde salon, but he was also an important force in the avant garde movement, although his style didn't explore the effects of light. His work was more Realist,
                          on par with early paintings by Monet, as well as the work of Gustave Courbet and Édouard Manet. He displayed work in subsequent Impressionist exhibitions, although
                           he famously boycotted the sixth one as he had opposed the inclusion of Degas, a rivalry that underlines how fraught associations in the Impressionist circle 
                           actually were. He participated the following year, in the seventh Impressionist exhibition, submitting 17 paintings, although there was turmoil once again as, 
                           evidently, Caillebotte and Pissarro were at odds, a situation that Monet mediated with some success. Monet and Caillebotte both refused to participate in the final
                            exhibition in 1886 but, by then, he had all but stopped painting completely.
                    </p>

                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>
                    In 1881, Caillebotte bought a house and property in Petit-Gennevilliers in the northwestern suburbs on the Seine River. He relocated there permanently in 1888. 
                    In 1882, he threw himself into a new hobby that consumed a great deal of his time (in addition to other collecting activities and gardening): constructing yachts,
                     which he already had experience racing. He spent the majority of his time with his brother Martial, and his good friend Renoir, who came often to visit the house
                      in Petit-Gennevilliers and enjoyed talking over subjects like philosophy, literature, politics, and art. Caillebotte never married, although he is thought to
                       have had a serious and long-term relationship with a woman named Charlotte Berthier. She was 11 years younger than him and apparently from a lower-class family;
                        when he died, Caillebotte left her a large annuity.
                </p>
                <h3>Late Period</h3>
                <div class="image-block">
                    <p>
                    By the early 1890s, Caillebotte was barely painting; he had stopped producing the large, ambitious canvases of previous decades. In 1894, at the age of 45, he was working 
                    in the garden at his home in Petit-Gennevilliers when he collapsed, dying suddenly of a stroke. He was buried at the famous Pere Lachaise Cemetery in southeastern Paris.

                <div class="image-block">
                    <p>
                    Following Caillebotte's death, his estate, in keeping with his will, attempted to make a generous donation to the French State. The artist had drafted his will very early 
                    in his life, in 1876, following the untimely passing of his brother, Rene. His will read, "I give to the French State the paintings which I have; nevertheless, since I want 
                    that this donation be accepted and in such a manner that the paintings go neither in an attic nor in a provincial museum, but...in the Luxembourg Museum and later in the 
                    Louvre Museum, it is necessary that a certain time passes before execution of this clause..." He had stipulated that twenty years should pass before the paintings would be
                     turned over by his brother Martial and the executor of his estate, Renoir.
                    </p>

                <h3>The Legacy of Gustave Caillebotte</h3>
                <p>Caillebotte's style, which so outraged critics and academics in his day, conversely inspired artists who followed him to use some of his more radical compositional techniques.
                     For instance, the often highly unusual perspectives - looking from below up a slanting floor, gazing down from a non-descript perch or standing on the edge of an intimate 
                     scene - and the unconventional cropping resembling photographs were features of paintings by avant-garde artists ranging from Van Gogh to Picasso. The use of photographs
                      to construct images became commonplace extending even to the Photorealists (also known as Hyperrealist or Super-realists) of the 1970s.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He is also credited not only with influencing painters but also photographers such as Jeff Wall, whose 1982 work, Mimic, uses extreme perspectives and also emphasizes class
                     tension as was so strongly the case with, for example, Caillebotte's Pont de l'Europe. Caillebotte's legacy as a patron is also more than noteworthy as the works he bequeathed
                      to the French State created the foundation for the country's extensive collection of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings as well as the renowned Barnes Collection
                       in the United States.
