                        Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec was a 19th-century French painter, illustrator and poster artist, known for his atmospheric depiction of the Parisian underworld.
                        Besides his work as an artist, his height (only 152 cm), and scandalous behaviour in society brought him notoriety. He is one of the most famous 
                        post-impressionist painters of the era, whose style was also influenced by Art Nouveau, and the topics he focused on centred around the bohemian life on the 
                        streets, in brothels, theatres and bars in Paris. Although he died young and his whole career lasted less than 20 years, he managed to produce a great number 
                        of for the time modern, provocative and decadent images that give us a real picture of what Parisian nightlife was like at the end of the 19th century.

                <h3>Childhood and education</h3>
                <div class="image-block">
                    <p>
                        Toulouse-Lautrec’s family was wealthy and had a lineage that extended without interruption back to the time of Charlemagne. He grew up amid his family's typically 
                        aristocratic love of sport and art. Most of the boy’s time was spent at the Château du Bosc, one of the family estates located near Albi. Henri's grandfather, 
                        father, and uncle were all talented draftsmen, and thus it was hardly surprising that Henri began sketching at the age of 10. His interest in art grew as a 
                        result of his being incapacitated in 1878 by an accident in which he broke his left thighbone. His right thighbone was fractured a little more than a year later
                         in a second mishap. These accidents, requiring extensive periods of convalescence and often painful treatments, left his legs atrophied and made walking most 
                         difficult. As a result, Toulouse-Lautrec devoted ever greater periods to art in order to pass away the frequently lonely hours.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Toulouse-Lautrec’s first visit to Paris occurred in 1872, when he enrolled in the Lycée Fontanes (now Lycée Condorcet). He gradually moved on to private tutors, 
                        and it was only after he had passed the baccalaureate examinations, in 1881, that he resolved to become an artist.

                <p>
                    His first professional teacher in painting was René Princeteau, a friend of the Lautrec family. Princeteau’s fame, such as it was, arose from his depiction of 
                    military and equestrian subjects, done in a 19th-century academic style. Though Toulouse-Lautrec got on well with Princeteau, he moved on to the atelier of Léon
                     Bonnat at the end of 1882. In Bonnat, Toulouse-Lautrec encountered an artist who fought vehemently against deviation from academic rules, condemned the slapdash
                      approach of the Impressionists, and judged Toulouse-Lautrec’s drawing “atrocious.” His work received a more positive reaction in 1883, when he joined the studio
                       of Fernand Cormon.

                <h3>The documenter of Montmartre</h3>

                    </figure>
                    <p>
                        Thus it was that in the mid-1880s Toulouse-Lautrec began his lifelong association with the bohemian life of Montmartre. The cafés, cabarets, entertainers, and 
                        artists of this area of Paris fascinated him and led to his first taste of public recognition. He focused his attention on depicting popular entertainers such
                         as Aristide Bruant, Jane Avril, Loie Fuller, May Belfort, May Milton, Valentin le Désossé, Louise Weber (known as La Goulue [“the Glutton”]), and clowns such
                          as Cha-U-Kao and Chocolat.

                    <p>
                        The originality of Toulouse-Lautrec also emerged in his posters. Rejecting the notion of high art, done in the traditional medium of oil on canvas, Toulouse-Lautrec 
                        in 1891 did his first poster, Moulin Rouge—La Goulue. This poster won Toulouse-Lautrec increasing fame. “My poster is pasted today on the walls of Paris,” the artist 
                        proudly declared. It was one of more than 30 he would create in the 10 years before his death. Posters afforded Toulouse-Lautrec the possibility of a widespread impact 
                        for his art, no longer restricted by the limitations of easel painting. They also enhanced the success he had enjoyed in the preceding year when his works were shown in 
                        Brussels at the Exposition des XX (the Twenty), an avant-garde association, and in Paris at the Salon des Indépendants.

                <h3>The Legacy of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec</h3>
                <p>
                    Toulouse-Lautrec's career coincided with the expansion of the urban middle class - people with money to spend on entertainment, but who weren't part of high society. 
                    He anticipated and shaped the needs of this audience and his style began to make an impact during his lifetime, inspiring the exaggerated outlines, languid, organic forms
                     and script writing that appeared in the Art Nouveau movement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Toulouse-Lautrec's celebration of consumer culture and iconic popular advertisements paved the way for Pop art. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    One further aspect of Toulouse-Lautrec's achievement deserves special attention. Despite the celebrated freedom and individualism of modern art, few artists of any
                     period have been able to overcome social prejudice. While rubbing elbows with the riffraff was an acceptable, even encouraged, rite-of-passage among avant-garde 
                     artists, Degas, Manet, and Van Gogh maintained a certain aloofness from their working-class subjects. Toulouse-Lautrec was able to develop true friendships that 
                     transcended the rigid class structure of 19th-century Paris. His brilliant insights into the glitter and desperation of Paris nightlife, a study in contrasts, 
                     were not only more brilliant but more humane than any that had come before him, setting the bar high for future artists.
