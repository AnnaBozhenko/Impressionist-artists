                    Paul Gauguin is one of the most significant French artists to be initially schooled in Impressionism, but who broke
                     away from its fascination with the everyday world to pioneer a new style of painting broadly referred to as Symbolism.
                      As the Impressionist movement was culminating in the late 1880s, Gauguin experimented with new color theories and 
                      semi-decorative approaches to painting. He famously worked one summer in an intensely colorful style alongside Vincent
                       Van Gogh in the south of France, before turning his back entirely on Western society. He had already abandoned a former 
                       life as a stockbroker by the time he began traveling regularly to the south Pacific in the early 1890s, where he developed
                        a new style that married everyday observation with mystical symbolism, a style strongly influenced by the popular, 
                        so-called "primitive" arts of Africa, Asia, and French Polynesia. Gauguin's rejection of his European family, society, 
                        and the Paris art world for a life apart, in the land of the "Other," has come to serve as a romantic example of the
                         artist-as-wandering-mystic.

                <h3>Childhood</h3>
                <p>
                    Paul Gauguin was born to Clovis Gauguin, a journalist, and Alina Maria Chazal, daughter of the socialist leader and early feminist 
                    activist Flora Tristan. At the age of three, Gauguin and his family fled Paris for Lima, Peru, a move motivated by France's tenuous 
                    political climate that prohibited freedom of the press. On the trans-Atlantic journey, Clovis fell ill and died. For the next four 
                    years, Gauguin, his sister, and mother lived with extended relatives in Lima.
                </p>

                    <p>
                        In 1855, as France entered upon a more politically stable era, the surviving family returned to settle in the north-central French
                         city of Orleans, where they lived with Gauguin's grandfather. There, Gauguin began his formal education and eventually joined the 
                         merchant marine (compulsory service) at age seventeen. Three years later Gauguin joined the French Navy. Returning to Paris in 1872, 
                         Gauguin took up work as a stockbroker.

                <h3>Early training</h3>
                <div class="image-block">
                    <p>
                    Following his mother's death in 1867, Gauguin went to live with his appointed guardian, Gustave Arosa, a wealthy art patron and collector. 
                    Under Arosa's care, Gauguin was introduced to the work of the Romantic painter, Eugene Delacroix, as well as the work of Realist painter 
                    Gustave Courbet, Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, and the pre-Impressionist, Barbizon school of French landscape painting. This education of 
                    the artist's eye in the work of his close predecessors was to have a lasting effect on Gauguin's later work.

                <p>
                    Gauguin married Mette-Sophie Gad in 1873; subsequently, Gauguin, his Danish wife, and their five children moved from Paris to Copenhagen. 
                    Gauguin also began to collect art, procuring a modest array of Impressionist paintings by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Claude Monet, and Camille 
                    Pissarro. By 1880 Gauguin was himself painting in his spare time and employing an Impressionist style, as in his Still-Life with Fruit and 
                    Lemons (1880). Gauguin also took to frequently visiting galleries, and eventually he rented his own artist's studio. In addition, Gauguin
                     painted beside newly befriended artists Camille Pissarro and Paul Cézanne, and he himself participated in the official Impressionist exhibitions 
                     in Paris of 1881 and 1882.

                <h3>Mature Period</h3>
                <div class="image-block">
                    <p>
                    By the late 1880s, Gauguin's work caught the attention of Vincent van Gogh, another young and gifted painter who, like Gauguin, frequently suffered 
                    from bouts of depression. Similarly to Gauguin's, van Gogh's painting - while distinctly Impressionistic - showed the potential to blossom into 
                    something entirely new. The two artists began a regular correspondence, during which they exchanged paintings, including self-portraits, among
                     them Gauguin's Self-Portrait 'Les Miserables' (1888). In 1888, at van Gogh's invitation, the two men lived and worked together for nine weeks
                      in van Gogh's rented house at Arles in the south of France. Van Gogh's brother and benefactor, Theo van Gogh, an art dealer by profession, 
                      served as Gauguin's primary business manager and artistic confident at the time.

                    <figcaption>Бачення після проповіді</figcaption>
                </figure>
                </div>
                <p>
                    During these nine weeks, both artists turned out an impressive number of canvases, among Gauguin's his now-famous Night Café at Arles (Mme Ginoux)
                     and a signature early work, Vision After the Sermon (Jacob's Fight with the Angel) (both 1888). Neither man had a particularly promising reputation
                      in the art world at this moment; rather, both were regarded as highly experimental painters searching for a new style that might depart from the 
                      mature Impressionism of Monet, Renoir, and Pissarro. The intensity of the artistic exchange would come to a dramatic conclusion as, by the end of 
                      nine weeks, van Gogh's depressive and occasionally violent emotional episodes led to the dissolution of their artistic partnership, although the 
                      two would forever admire each other's work.
                </p>
                <h3>Late period</h3>
                <p>
                    In 1891, after spending years away from his wife and children, Gauguin effectively abandoned his family by moving alone, like a perpetual, solitary 
                    wanderer, to French Polynesia, where he would remain for the rest of his days. This move was the culmination of Gauguin's increasing desire to escape
                     what he regarded as an artificial European culture for a life in a more "natural" condition
                </p>
                <div class="image-block">
                    <p>
                    In his final decade, Gauguin lived in Tahiti, and subsequently Punaauia, finally making his way to the Marquesas Islands. During this time he 
                    painted more traditional portraits, such as Tahitian Women on the Beach (1891), The Moon and the Earth (Hina tefatou) (1893), and Two Tahitian 
                    Women (1899). He also continued to experiment with quasi-religious and Symbolist subject matter, as in his Manao Tupapau (The Spirit of the Dead
                     Keeps Watch) (1892), and his Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going? (1897). These works were painted during a period in which 
                     Gauguin was essentially bidding his career adieu, as if he were an athlete "at the top of his game," so to speak, but wanting to aspire towards
                      a more spiritual condition. Seeking an unworldly sense of repose and detachment, he is said to have been obsessed with his own mortality. He
                       looked back on his life and even borrowed figures from his own earlier paintings, perhaps as though to symbolically lend them an extended 
                       lifespan. Notably, by 1899 Gauguin was referring to himself satirically, writing to a Paris colleague that he painted only "on Sundays and
                        holidays," ironically like the amateur he once embodied prior to pursuing art seriously. Not long after that self-deprecating quip, he 
                        unsuccessfully attempted suicide by self-poisoning.

                </figure>
                <p>In early May, 1903, morally skittish, and weakened by drug-addiction and regular bouts with illness, Gauguin succumbed to the degenerative effects
                     of syphilis and died at the age of 54, in the Marquesas islands, where he was subsequently buried.

                <h3>The Legacy of Paul Gauguin</h3>
                <p>
                    Gauguin's naturalistic forms and "primitive" subject matter would embolden an entire, younger generation of painters to move decisively away from 
                    late Impressionism and pursue more abstract, or poetically inclined subjects, some inspired by French Symbolist poetry, others derived from myth, 
                    ancient history, and non-Western cultural traditions for motifs with which they might refer to the more spiritual and supernatural aspects of human
                     experience. Gauguin ultimately proved extremely influential to 20th-century modern art, in particular that of Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque and 
                     their development of Cubism from about 1911 to 1915. Likewise, Gauguin's endorsement of bold color palettes would have a direct effect on the Fauvists, 
                     most notably André Derain and Henri Matisse, both of whom would frequently employ intensely resonant, emotionally expressive, and otherwise "un-realistic" color.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gauguin, the man, became a legend almost independently of his art and came to inspire a number of literary works based on his "exotic" life story - 
                    a prime example being W. Somerset Maugham's The Moon and Sixpence (1919).
